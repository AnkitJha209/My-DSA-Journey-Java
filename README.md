# My DSA Learning Journey

## Course Details
I am learning Data Structures and Algorithms following Love Babbar's DSA Course. While the original course is in C++, I will be implementing everything in Java to strengthen my Java programming skills.

## Learning Path
- Following Love Babbar's DSA Playlist on YouTube
- Converting C++ implementations to Java
- Daily practice and implementation
- Focus on problem-solving techniques

## Topics to be Covered
1. Basic Programming Concepts
2. Arrays & Strings
3. Searching & Sorting
4. Linked Lists
5. Stacks & Queues
6. Trees
7. Graphs
8. Dynamic Programming
9. Many more advanced topics

## Resources
- Main Course: Love Babbar DSA YouTube Playlist
- Practice Platform: LeetCode
- Language: Java
- Additional Reference: GeeksForGeeks

## Goals
- Complete entire playlist
- Implement all data structures in Java
- Solve associated problems
- Build strong DSA foundation
